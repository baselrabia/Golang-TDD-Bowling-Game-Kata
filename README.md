# bowling-game-kata-TDD-Golang 

This is Uncle Bob's bowling game kata to practice test-driven development. There is very little creativity involved here, as he instructs you in his Powerpoint how to accomplish each step. It's meant more as a repetition exercise to turn these steps and refactoring into muscle memory so that you can apply them to other projects.

## running the test 

```bash 
go test ./... -v
